# Rick-and-Morty-Final-Project

Open Which_Episode_or_Which_Strain.ipynb to see the final matches.

If you want to run the program yourself, please see requirements.txt and make sure that you have all the required libraries installed.
After installing the libraries, download Scraper.py and run python3 Scraper.py --source remote on Command Line to run.
The program scrapes through ~2000 webpages in total. So please patient when running it. The estimated time to run everything is about 12 minutes. 

The .db and .csv files are files that you will generate if you run the code in .py file.


Enjoy! Leave a comment if you have any suggestions to make the code better.
